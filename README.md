# What is this thing?
Electric is a project that allows you to control your iCharger from your mobile phone (iOS / Android, windows what?) - regardless of whether you are at home or at the field.

This GitHub project provides the server software to control the iCharger 308/406/4010 DUO from a mobile app - and the server software *only* runs on a Raspberry Pi 3.

# So why should I use this?
Well, that's pretty easy to explain - here's our list of unique selling points:
  1. It looks great on your phone.
  1. It's got wow factor - use your iCharger from your deck chair while at the field.
  1. Set up new / existing presets, charge, discharge and store your packs - all from said deck chair.
  1. Use the app at the field as well as on your home WIFI network.
