# Beta Testing

***WARNING*** OUT OF DATE AND NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

This second is devoted to getting you up & running as a BETA tester.  

You will need a Raspberry Pi 3, some terminal skills, connectivity to Mr Internet and about 45 minutes :-) 

## Prepare the Raspberry Pi 3
Read these instructions all the way through - to the bottom of the file BEFORE beginning - there is useful info everywhere.  

Remember to do the following, so that a user-space program can access the iCharger:
  
    echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5751", MODE:="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/10-icharger.rules

## Install the Hypriot Image

Go an grab their flashing tool from here: https://github.com/hypriot/flash

Install the OS, and log into it via terminal / SSH. 

## Configure WIFI and Update via APT

1. Enable WIFI, log in and edit /boot/device-init.yaml

       wifi:
         interfaces:
           wlan0:
             ssid: "MyNetwork"
             password: "secret_password"

1. get the system updated

       $ sudo apt-get update 
       $ sudo apt-get upgrade
       $ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ python-dev

## Install the Electric codebase using PyPi

1. pull down pip
       
       $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
       $ sudo python get-pip.py

1. install electric from PyPi 

       $ sudo pip install electric
       
**WARNING** this can take about 45 minutes - because it will cause hidapi and zeromq compilation jobs.  And the Pi 
is very slow with compiling.  Very very slow.  

## To run the server

1. Run a Terminal then type:

       $ electric-worker-cmd
    
1. Run another Terminal and type: 

       $ electric-server-cmd
